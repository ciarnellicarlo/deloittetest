# deloittetest

Since this was a frontend test, I decided to use Local storage for the authentification process instead of a backend.

The framework of choice is Vue, but I made all the authentification process with vanilla JS.

I have also used Bootstrap as a CSS framework, and some SCSS.

Hope you enjoy my project :)
